# SFML Game Development

Source code written while reading "SFML Game Development by Example" book by
Raimondas Pupius.

## Setup

Clone repository:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/i9or/sfml-game-development.git
```

The code itself was written and tested in CLion on macOS Monterrey.
However, it should be possible to use CMake from the command line:

```sh
cd ./sfml-game-development
mkdir build
cd ./build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run appropriate executable in the `bin` folder.
